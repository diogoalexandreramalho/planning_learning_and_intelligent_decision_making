# Planning, Learning and Intelligent Decision Making

## About the Project

*This repository includes the code developed in the course Planning, Learning and Intelligent Decision Making of my MSc in Computer Science.*

The code is related to five distainct labs:

1. Markov Chains and PageRank
2. Markov Decision Process (MDP)
3. Partially Observable Markov Decision Problem (POMDP)
4. Classification of handwritten digits
5. Reinforcement Learning


## Contributors
These labs were completed by Diogo Ramalho and Renato Bernardino.
